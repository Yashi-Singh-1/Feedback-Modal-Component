**Feedback Modal Component**

**Challenge Requirements**
The Feedback Modal Component should be triggered by a button, and it should appear as a modal overlay on top of the current page. The modal should include a rating scale that allows users to rate a product on a scale of 1 to 10. Users should be able to select a rating by clicking on a number in the scale. The modal should close when the user submits their feedback. The modal should get closed by clicking on a “Cancel” button or by clicking outside of the modal. Show the hover state of all the elements. The component should be responsive and display correctly on different screen sizes.
